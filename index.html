  <p>For our assignments, we went with the strategy of "Giving Way to Your worst impulse."  For mine, I created a plain sketch.  I then started to add 
    layers of color underneath the sketch; however, everytime I checked my phone, I added a new layer of color.  In total, I have 68 different layers 
    of just coloring.</p>

  <p>For this assignment, our group chose “Give way to your worst impulse” as our instruction. We interpreted this something along the lines of giving into a temptation, whatever that may be. For me, an everyday temptation is sleeping in longer than I should. I depicted this through illustrating myself in bed turned away from a window letting light into the room with also a clock showing that the time is well into the afternoon. I made this first thing after sleeping in then waking up.</p>

  <p>Our group chose to do the 'give way to your worst impulse' strategy. My worst impulse is to look at my phone so I chose to count how many times I did that over two days. Each time I picked up my phone, I made a note for why I did it and would edit the number for each time. At the end of the second day, I decided to make something to represent the results of this little experiment. This resulted in me drawing a phone with icons and numbers over them. The icons represent the reason I checked my phone and the numbers are how many times. I think that my piece turned out good, but I do wish I could have done more with it since it looks so simple. At first I thought about putting the icons on the canvas for the amount of times, but it seemed to be too much work so in the end I decided to simplify it. My project was made in a free drawing program called Krita and I used the shape and drawing tools to create it.</p>

<p>The way I interpreted 'Give in to your worst impulse,' I thought of distracting myself. So using my phone, I made a video of myself trying to study for my art classes, even though I interrupted my own work by reading fandom articles instead of the class readings. Hopefully this way, I still remember what subjects are important to me, between movies like Toy Story 4 and preparations for my future career..</p>

  <p>For this assignment, I really just drew what I liked at the time.  I was really into drawing skulls, beanies, and trippy looking patterns.  For my ART 1 class, we had the opportunity for an assignment to create anything, so I put the three together.  This piece was just supposed to be fun and free.</p>

  <p>This assignment was for my Photo 40 class.  This picture is only one out of a series of four pictures.  This series of pictures was just supposed to capture different aspects of fashion and style.  Through this picture (and the other three) I wanted to capture the image of what has been popular during today's trends.</p>

  <p>This was a portrait assignment for my PHOTO 40 class.  Through this photo, I wanted to capture the laughter, happiness, and positivity shown from this individual, naturally.  To get this photo, I didn't tell the subjects when I was taking pictures purposely to get the most candid pictures as possible.</p>
